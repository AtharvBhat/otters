## 0.1.0-alpha1 - 2025-09-08
- Initial pre-release.
- SIMD-accelerated vector search with metadata filtering (MetaStore + VecStore).
- Early-stage: frequent breaking changes expected.

Changes since planning:
- Package renamed on crates.io to `otters-rs`. The library crate name remains `otters`, so `use otters::...` continues to work. Badges and docs links updated accordingly.
